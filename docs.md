## 📐 SwiftLink - Modern Shortener Link Project

The SwiftLink project is a .NET 8 application designed to streamline the process of link shortening. It provides a comprehensive solution for creating shorter, more manageable URLs, which is particularly useful for sharing links on platforms where space is limited or for tracking and managing links more efficiently. The project includes instructions for setting up the environment, including database migration and the use of a Redis container for caching, indicating a focus on performance and scalability.
